# DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS

## AIM:
To write a python program to find the distance two 2 points
## ALGORITHM:
### Step 1: 
Using import math function,do the calculations.
### Step 2: 
Take the two coordinates as l1 and l2.
### Step 3: 
Substitute the values in the distance formula

import math
x1,x2,y1,y2=4,10,2,6
distance=(((x2-x1)**2)+(y2-y1)**2)**0.5
print("{0:.2f}".format(distance))
```
